## Description

This project is an **Dart** + **Flutter** application to store your favorite videos to have them at hand and watch them directly within the application in Picture-in-Picture mode (the small floating player).

It is my first Flutter App consuming an [API RESTful](https://github.com/Omar-Pecos/api-node-apm) with the help of **Dio** and using Futures and FutureBuilders.

### Functions

- Add new videos to the list
- Edit video properties in the list
- Delete videos from the list
- Play videos inside the app in a different screen or in PIP (Picture-in-Picture) mode
